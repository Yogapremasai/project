    <h4>Who is the best hero in Shadow Fight Arena?</h4> 
   <P class="tem">
    This is the only character on our list that is not primarily an anchor, considering that her main focus is not just to defeat enemies with crushing blows,
    but to suppress them by draining their shadow energy. In other words, Kate might be more useful as a counter to characters that rely on their shadow forms, rather than an actual anchor. However, she has more than enough damage potential to take down just about anyone, as long as you learn about her moveset and skills.

    unlocked by leveling up, which can let her burn even more energy per strike, or increase her damage output significantly at the beginning of every round. 
    Just like Shang, Kate is available from the very beginning, which makes a good choice early on.

    <h4>Who is Ironclad?</h4>
    <p class="tem">
        Though Ironclad is also unlockable from the beginning, you need to first collect his cards to obtain him. However, when you achieve this, you’ll find that he’s one of the most satisfying characters to play.

        Unlike most other characters in Shadow Fight Arena, Ironclad doesn’t rely on weapons or flashy attacks.
        Instead, he dons heavy armor and fights enemies head on using only his fists and martial abilities. 
        Though he can start off as fragile as other characters, Ironclad gradually develops his defenses whenever he gets hit, thanks to his “Stubborn as a Mule” passive, which grants him a “Stubbornness” stack that increases his damage resistance, whenever he takes a hit.
        Additionally, he can easily counter characters with ranged capabilities as Ironclad not only has tougher defenses with which he can shrug off most weaker attacks, but can also turn invincible temporarily whenever he’s
        hit with a ranged move. This character is all about using brute force to pummel your opponents, which is further supported by his short range attacks and hand-to-hand capabilities.

    <h4>who is Fireguard?</h4>
    <p class="tem">
        his character can only be unlocked at account level 2 and onward, and is one of the most 
        interesting choices at this point due to his focus on attacks that deal continuous damage, 
        rather than relying on strong and cumbersome blows.Though he can start off as fragile as other characters, Ironclad gradually 
        develops his defenses whenever he gets hit,
